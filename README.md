# Install

Drag all the files except README.md into Stand/Lua Scripts.

# Setup

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and create a new key. Copy it, because once you close the pop-up, you can no longer view or copy the API key.

2. Run the script, click "Enter OpenAI API key", and paste in the key, then hit enter.

3. The script will relaunch. Done!

You may want to set usage limits if you are using a paid plan. If you are on a free trial this is not available.
